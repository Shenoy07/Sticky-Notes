# Why did I make Sticky Notes?

Recently I started learning about the web in detail and it has been a fun journey till now. I have a full time job which has nothing to do with web development.
Its been 2 months nows that I have been dedicating my time after work to learn web development. As you can see on my github profile, it started with simple css and html projects.
After that I spent quite some time learning javascript and made a project using it. 
And now when it was time for learning React I decided to all-in my learnings and see what all I can do with simple react and my front end skills.
The above app is the result of the same.

# My Learnings

1. I learnt the basic concepts of react hooks.
2. We used css flex and grid to position elements which is considered to be a good practice.
3. We should always keep the css and sizes in relative measurements and not px or %.(We will be improving our apps based on those as well)
4. Used the arrow functions correctly, got familiar with those.
5. And many more things which will be mentioning on my upcoming blog regarding the same!


# Future

We will be adding a lot of new features to the app. Some of them are as follows:
1. Edit the notes.
2. Add a form validation for not taking empty notes!
3. Give the user the oppurtunity to select their own color palette and help them arrange the notes on the grid manually.
4. We will be connecting Database and adding a Login Page
