# Why did I make Sticky Notes?

Recently I started learning about the web in detail and it has been a fun journey till now. I have a full time job which has nothing to do with web development.
Its been 2 months nows that I have been dedicating my time after work to learn web development. As you can see on my github profile, it started with simple css and html projects.
After that I spent quite some time learning javascript and made a project using it. 
And now when it was time for learning React I decided to all-in my learnings and see what all I can do with simple react and my front end skills.
The above app is the result of the same.
